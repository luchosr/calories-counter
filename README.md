# Calories Tracker App

## Description and Motivation

- This is an app to track daily calories burned during exercise or added up in food intake.

- I used React.js for its simplicity and component-oriented capabilities with TypeScript to avoid type-related errors at compile time and ship safe code, context APi fot sharing the data across the entire App's components, and TailwindCSS to apply styles because it's a very fast way to apply styles in your code.

## How to Install and Run the Project

- You can clone the repo, make a cd into the project folder and then run `pnpm install` for installing the dependencies, then you can run `pnpm dev` and the project will start on development mode.

- If you want, you can access a project's deployment [here.](https://calories-counter-rho.vercel.app/)
